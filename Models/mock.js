      "For generations, the people of Wakanda have followed and worshipped the Black Panther, a superior warrior granted extra abilities by the Panther God upon proving him or herself worthy in a combat tournament open to all Wakandans.Wakanda stands apart from many nations because of its advanced technological nature, well-integrated with centuries-old traditions. Intent on keeping to itself for generations, the nation often rebuked visitors while also refraining from interfering in larger world conflicts. Wakanda’s greatest natural resource, Vibranium, provides Wakanda both independence and technological superiority. The vibration-absorbing metal is cultivated in the Great Mound.For much of the modern era, T’Challa has worn the mantle of the Black Panther, acting as both Wakanda'’ champion and its king. However, unlike many of his predecessors, T’Challa often eschewed his peoples’ insular nature and journeyed out into the world—masked and unmasked—to become a hero to the entire globe and beyond.",

      "The younger daughter of history professor John Grey and his wife Elaine, Jean Grey was 10 years old when her mutant telepathic powers first manifested after experiencing the emotions of a dying friend. Her parents took her to be treated by Professor Charles Xavier. While Xavier treated Jean he also used her to fine tune his Cerebro machine. When Xavier introduced young Jean to the astral plane a part of her mind manifested as a Phoenix raptor and touched the mind of Scott Summers in the orphanage. Later, Xavier erected psychic shields in Jean’s mind to prevent her from using her telepathic powers until she was mature enough to control them. Eventually, using her telekinetic powers, Jean was a founding member of Xavier’s team of mutant trainees the X-Men as Marvel Girl. Upon a mission in outer space Jean was noticed by the Phoenix Force which took note of her unlimited potential. At this moment Jean had a vision of becoming the Phoenix but the vision faded from her memory as it ended. She soon fell in love with fellow student Scott Summers, and later would develop a strong attraction towards one of the team’s new recruits, the feral Wolverine.",

I saw thousands of murdered people burning in giant outdoor pits. I have seen at least a quarter million dead human beings with my own eyes...and I couldn't save a single one...",

He revealed to her that he had become the Hulk, and Jen invited him home so they could talk about it. On the way there, agents of Nicholas Trask, the crime boss who had killed Jen's mother years before, shot and seriously wounded her. She had been defending a gangster who had been double-crossed by Trask, and she had spread the rumor that she had evidence to incriminate Trask, which led to his retaliation. Bruce fended off the attackers and then broke into a doctor's office to treat her. Realizing Jennifer was going to die, Bruce gave her a transfusion of his own blood as there were no other supplies available. The transfusion that saved Jen's life Jen died, but, thanks to the transfusion, she was thrown into the Below-Place, where she was able to enter the metaphysical Green Door and come back to life. After she stabilized, he had her admitted to a local hospital. However, this came to the attention of the police, who considered Bruce a suspect in Jennifer's attack, and Bruce changed into the Hulk to flee. Meanwhile, Trask's thugs attempted a second hit on Jennifer, causing the gamma radiation particles in the transfused blood to activate, turning her skin green and increasing her size to well over six feet. Dubbed 'She-Hulk' by one of the goons, Jen trapped them for the police to find. With the emergency over, she reverted to her normal size and strength, successfully keeping her identity secret. From then on, She-Hulk would handle whatever Jennifer Walters could not.",
